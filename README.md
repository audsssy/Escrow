# LexDAO Escrow
Digital and legal programming for escrows.

## v1 - Dai Savings Escrow (DSE)

DSE stores deal details, permissions, and escrows Dai Stablecoin that can be resolved through lexDAO arbitration.  For interest accrual on escrowed Dai, DSE implements Chai wrapper for Dai Savings Rate. The Chai wrapper amount of escrowed Dai is paid out.  Future implementations will likely output Dai and involve additional logic for managing accrued interest.
